It seems unstable species He-6 wants to decay to Li-6, however this species is not in this run. This points to an inconsistency in the network build. Here we will ignore the abundance of He-6.
It seems unstable species Be-10 wants to decay to B-10, however this species is not in this run. This points to an inconsistency in the network build. Here we will ignore the abundance of Be-10.
Can't find element Th in isotopedatabase.txt
WARNING:
This initial abundance file uses an element name that does
not contain the mass number in the 3rd to 5th position.
It is assumed that this is the proton and we will change
the name to 'h   1' to be consistent with the notation used in
iniab.dat files
