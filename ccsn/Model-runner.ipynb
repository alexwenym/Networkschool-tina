    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook helps you execute the model code. This should be done after the Rate Changer made any rate changes (if those are desired) but before the Result Explorer analyzes the results. You must execute the model code after a rate change to be able to analyze the new results. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to go from cell to cell and execute the cell using the \"Play\" button (which executes the cell and advances to the next cell). Some cells will create a lot of output - you need carefully scroll past the output to the next cell. Some cells will take some time to run - you need to wait until its done (the cell number turns back from `[*]` to a number). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions - Step 1: Run the model\n",
    "The following cell executes the model program called `./run_ccsn.sh case`. It takes one argument `case` that is a ccsn model case number from the following table (the ccsn temperature and density as functions of time (trajectories) for these calculatons are extracted from the $15 M_\\odot$ model with\n",
    "the initial metallicity $Z=0.01$ from [paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJS..225...24P/abstract)):\n",

    "Once you start executing the cell with the \"Play\" button it will run for a few minutes and print some information along the way. The cell number on the left of the cell will turn into `[*]`. Be patient and wait until its done (`[*]` turns back to a number). It will produce about 200 (or less) cycles or time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "There may already be output from when this was run previously. Make sure you actually run the cell again (\"Play button\") - the output will then be recreated by the new calculation. Otherwise you do not get new results !!!\n",

    "Also make sure it says \"Bash\" in the upper right corner of the tab - if not go there and select it. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional information about what this does\n",
    "The model follows the nuclear reactions step by step as they create new isotopes over time. For each time step it will print a line (this information is mostly interesting for developers and experts) and create an output file with how much of each isotope has been created so far (isotope abundances). The output files are created in the same directory (= folder) where the code runs. The output file names contain numbers - the output file with the highest number will contain the isotope abundances at the end of the calculation. This is the data file that will be analyzed later. "
