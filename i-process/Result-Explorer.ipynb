This graph helps you identify the most abundant isotopes that have been produced. \n",

Find the file with the highest number - this will contain the abundances at the end of the calculation (a file is created for each step of the calculation). You can make the file browser window wider by sliding the boundary to the right so you can see the full filenames. \n",

    "4. You see a long list of isotopes and their abundances. The last two columns contain element name and mass number to identify the isotope. The number in the column before is the abundance in scientific notation. Scroll down or use the Find feature (`Command - F` on Mac, `CTRL - F` on windows) to find the isotope you are interested in. \n",

    "5. Once you are done, click on your group folder in the folder name on top of the file browser (example Group1 or Group2 or Group3) - this should be the name just before the results folder, separated by `/`. This will get you back to the folder (directory) you came from so you can select a different result folder. \n",

    "Note the notation of the isotopes is always 5 characters with the first two characters denoting the element symbol in all upper case, and the last three characters the mass number. Element symbol is left justified and mass number is right justified with unused characters being blanks. You need to use that format when searching (type exactly 5 characters). "
